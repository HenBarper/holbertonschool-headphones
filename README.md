## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to replicate a designer file and create a web page that mirrors the provided design. You won't be using any libraries for this project; instead, you'll leverage your understanding of HTML/CSS to build a responsive and accessible web page.

## Instructions

1. **HTML/CSS:** Implement the web page using only HTML and CSS. Structure your HTML to reflect the content and use CSS for styling.

2. **Accessibility:** Ensure that your web page is accessible. Pay attention to semantic HTML elements, use appropriate ARIA attributes, and provide alternative text for images.

3. **Responsive Design:** Make your web page responsive to different screen sizes. Utilize media queries to adjust styles based on desktop, tablet, and phone resolutions.

4. **Creativity:** While the main goal is to replicate the designer file, feel free to add your creative touch. Experiment with colors, fonts, and layout as long as it aligns with the overall design.
